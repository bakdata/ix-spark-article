# Apache Spark Demo on Wikipedia Data

To see the IPython notebook nicely formatted go to: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/bakdata/ix-spark-article/blob/master/examples.ipynb

This notebook comes along with an article that appeared in the (German) iX.
See: http://www.heise.de/ix/inhalt/2015/4/138/

I will do more polishing and add documentation soon.
